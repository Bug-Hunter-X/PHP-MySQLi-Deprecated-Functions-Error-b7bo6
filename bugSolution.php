This updated code uses the MySQLi extension which is the recommended and supported way to interact with MySQL databases in PHP.  It establishes a connection, executes a query, and fetches results using prepared statements for security. <?php $mysqli = new mysqli("localhost", "username", "password", "database_name"); if ($mysqli->connect_error) { die('Connect Error (' . $mysqli->connect_errno . ') '. $mysqli->connect_error); } $stmt = $mysqli->prepare("SELECT * FROM users"); $stmt->execute(); $result = $stmt->get_result(); while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) { echo "ID: " . $row["id"] . " Name: " . $row["name"] . "\n"; } $stmt->close(); $mysqli->close(); ?>
