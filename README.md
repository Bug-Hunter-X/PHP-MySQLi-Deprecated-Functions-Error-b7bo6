This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when upgrading PHP applications: the use of deprecated mysql_* functions. The `bug.php` file shows the incorrect code using these functions. `bugSolution.php` provides the correct code using the MySQLi extension which is the recommended approach.  The mysql_* functions are no longer supported in PHP 7.0 and above and using them will result in fatal errors.
